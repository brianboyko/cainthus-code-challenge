# Cainthus Front-End Code Challenge

## Warning - this code will not work without a Flickr API key and secret

To use the Flickr API requires the use of an API key and secret code. **This code should not be committed to github or any other version control repository.**

This program makes use of the dotenv library to provide environment variables.

In the root directory of the project, create a file called "secret.env".  This file is already in the gitignore, so it will not be uploaded if you wish to modify this code. 

In that secret.env file, add the following lines: 

```
FLICKR_API_KEY=[Your api key]
FLICKR_API_SECRET=[Your api secret]
```
